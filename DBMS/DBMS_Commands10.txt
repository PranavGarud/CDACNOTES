Data Warehouse : 

ETL
Extract Transform Load

ETL is always done using GUI tools

GUI Tools of ETL are of two types:
1)IDE Integrated Development Environment(Everything happens in one software)
2)RAD Rapid Application Development (Drag & Drop features, they will generate code for you)

ETL Tools:
1) Infomatica PowerCenter
2) Ab Initio
3) SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
4) Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)
5) Alteryx
6) Data Stage (Infosphere)
7) Azure Data Factory(Microsoft) - No.1


There are 2 Types of ETL Loads:
1) Full Load
2) Incremental Load

1) Full Load : First time done when the target D/W is empty.
So, therefore it is one time activity.

2) Incremental Load : Done after the full load.
Required to get the data from each source on daily basis to accomodate the new records which are
NOT there in the target D/W.
Incremental Load is done regularly.
Generally it is scheduled.
Incremental Load is first done in the "Staging Area".
Then from "Staging Area" it is loaded in the target D/W.
Staging Tables are used in the "Staging Area" to get the incremental load.
From Staging tables data finally goes in the Target D/W.

ETL Demo:
Source is SQL Server
Transformation is Aggregation
Target or Destination is Flat File.
Destination Flat File Path is C:\SSIS_Demos_CDAC
The file name should be Emp_Summary.txt

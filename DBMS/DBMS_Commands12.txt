Cassandra :
Feature :
1. Decentralized Architecture 
2. Data Model
3. Replication
4. Query Language : CQL(Cassandra Query Language) Does not support ANSI but
some of the functions are suppported.
5. High Write and Read Throughput 

Cluster
1 A cluster in Cassandra is a collection of nodes, essentially servers,that 
work together to store and manage large amount of data.


Compund Key :
CREATE TABLE learn_cassandra.users_by_country(
	country text,
	user_email text,
	first_name text,
	last_name text,
	age smallint,
	PRIMARY KEY((country),user_email)
			|	  |	
	       Partition Key  Clustering Column

In Cassendra, the Primary Key needs to be 
it s termed as Compund Key

CQLSH - Cassendra Shell

Key Space - It is a entry point. It is similar to a database in traditional relational database systems.

Replication Strategy : This determines the nodes on which replicas are placed.
a.Simple Strategy 
b.Network Topology Strategy

Replication Factor : This defines the number of copies of data to store on different  nodes.

Cassandra Lab Demos:

use default_keyspace;

create table t1(a int, b int, c int);--PK error(but i don't get)

create table t1(a int Primary Key, b int, c int);

Insert into t1 Values(1,100,200);
SyntaxException: line 1:15 no viable alternative at input 'Values' (Insert into [t1] Values...)

It is mandatory to mention columns
Insert into t1(a,b,c) Values(1,100,200);--Works dfine now!!

select * from t1; --Normal output like SQL!!!
 a | b   | c
---+-----+-----
 1 | 100 | 200

Insert into t1(a,b,c) Values(1,500,700); --It Works!! It Over Rides data from that table

 select * from t1;

 a | b   | c
---+-----+-----
 1 | 500 | 700


create table transactions
(trid int,
 country text,
 emailid text,
 amount int,
 Primary Key(country, emailid)
 ); --The above Pk is Known as Compound Key
    --Country is partition key and emailid is cluster column.

Insert into transactions(trid, country, emailid, amount) Values(1, 'India', 'a@abc.com', 3000);	
Insert into transactions(trid, country, emailid, amount) Values(2, 'India', 'b@abc.com', 4000);
Insert into transactions(trid, country, emailid, amount) Values(3, 'Australia', 'c@abc.com', 493000);
Insert into transactions(trid, country, emailid, amount) Values(3, 'Australia', 'd@abc.com', 10000);

select * from transactions;

 country   | emailid   | amount | trid
-----------+-----------+--------+------
     India | a@abc.com |   3000 |    1
     India | b@abc.com |   4000 |    2
 Australia | c@abc.com | 493000 |    3
 Australia | d@abc.com |  10000 |    3

select * 
from transactions 
where amount > 4000;
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus 
may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"

select * 
from transactions 
where amount > 4000 Allow Filtering; 
 country   | emailid   | amount | trid
-----------+-----------+--------+------
 Australia | c@abc.com | 493000 |    3
 Australia | d@abc.com |  10000 |    3

select * from emp where ename = 'smith' allow filtering;

Delete form transactions
where country = 'India' and emailid = 'a@abc.com'; --Works fine now!!

select * from transactions; --Cross check

TTL : Time To Leave
Insert into txt1(Id,Name,Descr)







































2 Each node in a cluster holds data and participates in the cluster's
operations, ensuring both high availability and fault tolerance.

Node
1 In cassandra a node is an individual machine in the cluster.

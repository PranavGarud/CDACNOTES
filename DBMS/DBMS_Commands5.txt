Joins:

Mostly it is required when we need to display columns (data) from 2 or multiple tables based on the matching or non matching values of the 
common colums within those tables.

Generally useful to show data from parent and child tables.

This is a feature used only in SQL Databases.

Supported by ANSI SQL

Types of Joins:

Distinctly there are 3 types of joins.
1)Inner
2)Outer
3)Cross.

-----------------------------------------
1)Inner Join:
a)Equi Join
b)Non Equi JOin

There are 2 Types of syntaxes of Inner Joins:
1)ANSI 89
2)ANSI 92 or 2000 or above ( Highly Recommended)

Inner Join : Equi Join : Display data from tables based on only matching values of the common columns.

Examples of ANSI 89 Syntax --

Select EName,DName
From Emp, Dept
Where Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno;

Select EName,DName
From Emp Inner Join Dept; -- Landed accidentally in Cross Join!!!

ANSI 92 or above syntax : 

Select EName,DName
From Emp Inner Join Dept
On Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno;

Select EName,DName
From Emp Inner Join Dept; --Although MySQL gives cross join other all SQL database throw error


Select EName,DName,Deptno  --Error Column name is ambiguous.
From Emp Inner Join Dept
On Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno; 

Select EName,DName,Emp.Deptno
From Emp Inner Join Dept
On Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno;	 -- Rectified 

Select Emp.EName,Dept.DName,Emp.Deptno
From Emp Inner Join Dept
On Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno;	

The BEST Pratice is as shown Below;

Select e.EName,d.DName,e.Deptno
From Emp e Join Dept d
On e.Deptno = d.Deptno;	

Join Condition and Fileter Condition Together :

Select ename , dname,sal
from emp join dept
on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
where sal > 2000;

Select ename , dname,sal
from emp join dept
on emp.deptno = dept.deptno AND sal > 2000;

Select ename , dname,sal
from emp join dept
on emp.deptno = dept.deptno AND sal > 2000;  --Partial Cross Join


Examples of NonEQu join Join:
Select e.ename , e.sal, sg.grade
from emp e join Salgrade sg
on emp.Sal Between sg.losal AND sg.hisal;


More than 2 tables joins:

Select ename,dname,pname
from e join d
on e.deptno = d.deptno
join p
on d.pcode = p.pcode;

Select username,privname
from user join upm
on users.userid = upm.userid


----------------------------------------

Outer Join:

Outer Join is extension of Inner Join.

Types of Outer Join :
1)Left Outer Join
2)Right Outer Join
3)Full Outer Join

1)Left Outer Join :

Select Ename,Dname
From Emp1 Left Outer Join Dept1
On Emp1.Deptno = Dept1.Deptno;

Left Outer Join Matching records from both the tables and remaining all records of left table.


2)Right Outer Join :
Select Ename,Dname
From Dept1 Left Outer Join Emp1
On Emp1.Deptno = Dept1.Deptno; --It considers Dname as left outer join.

Right Outer Join Matching records from both the tables and remaining all records of right table.

Select Ename,Dname
From Emp1 Right Outer Join Dept1
On Emp1.Deptno =  Dept1.Deptno;


Full Outer Join = Inner + Remaining of Left Tabe + Remaining of Right Table

Select Ename,Dname
From Emp1 Full Outer Join Dept1
On Emp1.Deptno =  Dept1.Deptno;
*-*Full Outer Join Is Not Supported in MYSQL.

Left or Right Outer Join can also be used to show "Only Non Matching value records",
Display enames from  emp1 where depno is not matching as per dept1.

Select Ename,Dname
From Emp1 Left Outer Join Dept1
On Emp1.Deptno = Dept1.Deptno
Where Dept1.Deptno is Null;

Select Ename as "ENames Not in Dept1"
From Emp1 Left Outer Join Dept1
On Emp1.Deptno = Dept1.Deptno
Where Dept1.Deptno is Null;



Select ename ,dname
from emp cross join dept
on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cross Joins :

Select scheme, roi, code, month, roi * month as "Final Value"
from rates cross join period;


Where Dept1.Deptno is NULL;

---------------------------------------------

Self Join:
It means joining the same table with itself.

1)It is useful when the PK and FK exists int the same table.That means we have hierarchical data in
the single table.

select e.ename as "Sub Ordinate",m.ename as "Manager"
from emp e join emp m
on e.mgr = m.empno;

select e.ename as "Sub Ordinate",m.ename as "Manager"
from emp e left join emp m
on e.mgr = m.empno;

select e.ename as "Sub Ordinate", IfNull(m.ename , "No Manager") As "Manager"
from emp e left join emp m
on e.mgr = m.empno;

2)To display the duplicate rows which have unique primary Key but the 
remaining record getting duplicated.

Select e.*
from emp e join emp m
on e.empno <> m.empno
	and e.ename = m.ename
	and e.job = m.job
	and e.sal = m.sal;

Join on Expression:
Select ename, sal, sal+amount as "Take Home Salary"
from emp e join bonus b
on year(e.hiredate) = b.joy;


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Duplicating a table:

Create Table newemp
as 
select * from emp;


2)Duplicating the table with some rows

Create table newemp2
as
select * from emp
where job = 'clerk';


3)Dupicating the table without records

Create Table newemp3
as 
select * from emp
where 5>78;


4) Duplicating the table with some columns

Create table newemp4
as
select empno,ename,deptno, job from emp;





Referential Integrity : (MySQL can have some exceptions)

1) ON DELET CASCADE :When the parent record are deleted then the corresponding child records 
will get deleted.It is a weak Entity.


2)ON DELET SET NULL : When the parent record are deleted then the corresponding child table's
foregin key values becomes null.It is a strong Entity.

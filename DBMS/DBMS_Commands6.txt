Normalization :
A Non-Key attribute should be placed in only one entity
This proccess of placing attributes in the correct entities is called normalization.

Flar File - Zero Normal Form (0NF) : Every thing is in the single hetrogenous file.

The Column which have underline is primary key.

Transitive Dependency : Whenever non key column depandant on another non - key then it is
transitive dependenct.

First Normal Form (1NF)  : Attributes must not repeat within a table. No repeating groups.
Second Normal Form (2NF) : An attribute must relate to the entire Primary key , not just a protion.
			   Tables with a single 
Third Normal Form (3NF)  :
Fourth Normal Form (4NF) : Addresses multivalued dependencies.

Entity - Relationship Model :
* Used for conceptual data modeling
* Developed by Peter Chen in 1976
* made up of entities, attributes and cardinality (i.e.,relationships) within the entities.


Entity :
* Person,place,object,event or concepth about which an organization
  (or users) want to maintian data about(or track)
Examples:
-Person : Employee,student,patient
-Place  : State,Region,Country
-Object : Machine,Building,Automobile

Attributes :
* Properties of an entity are attributes.
* Attributes tell the characteristics of that entity.

Cardinality :
*Cardinality refers to the number of occurrences of common 
 column of one entity that can or must
 be linked with number of occurrences of common
 column of another entity.

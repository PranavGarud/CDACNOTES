Two types of calculated fields -

2. Without Parameter

Main use of calculated fields is to create KPIs
KPI - Key Performance Indicator (Most Valuable,Typically Numeric)

KPIs

Using Calculated fields, check if actual ship date is same as 
expected ship date. If they are same, then that order is On 
Time otherwise it is Delayed.

Shipment Days - Number

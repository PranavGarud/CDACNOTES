Q. Create the following users, groups, and group memberships:

-A group named admin

# groupadd admin

-A user harry who belongs to admin as a secondary group

# useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G admin harry

-A user natasha who also belongs to admin as a secondary group

# useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G admin natasha

-A user sarah who does not have access to an interactive shell on the system, and who is not a member of admin

# useradd -m -s /bin/nologin sarah

- harry, natasha, and sarah should all have the password as "password@123"

# passwd users


NOTE: make sure you have home dirs for all the users and all the users must have the shell /bin/bash.
